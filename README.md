# Movie Recommendation System

With the proliferation of streaming platforms and increased availability of content, users are faced with a vast array of films, which can make
decision-making challenging. In this context, a film recommendation system based on user preferences
offers an effective solution to help users discover new films that match their personal tastes. This project
aims to develop such a system, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques to analyze user viewing
habits and recommend similar films based on their preferences. By focusing on films liked by the user as
well as those in the same style, this system aims to enhance the cinematic discovery experience for users.
