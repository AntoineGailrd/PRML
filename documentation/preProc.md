# Raw data pre-processing

Before using any model a preprocessing need to be done. To start
retrieving the raw coherent data, we perform an initial filtering by assessing the degree of similarity
between two users based on the films they liked in common or rated in the same way. Then to
choose the rights movie what we need to do is to choose a movie that a user with a high degree of
similarity gave a good rate to. Doing this process for every user with a high similarity and taking
off movies that user have already see gives us a list of movie that could potentially be interesting
for the user.
