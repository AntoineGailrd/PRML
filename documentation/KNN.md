# Python Code Analysis

This section presents an analysis of a Python script designed for movie recommendation using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) method.

## Library Imports
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `NearestNeighbors` from `sklearn.neighbors` for the KNN algorithm.

## Data Loading
- A dataset `merged.csv` is loaded into a DataFrame `data` which includes `userId`, `movieId`, and `rating`.

## Data Transformation
- Creation of a user-item matrix and filling missing values with zeros.

## Model Initialization
- A KNN model is initialized with the `cosine` metric and `brute` algorithm to find 5 nearest neighbors.

## Recommendation Function
- The function `recommend_movie_for_user` identifies the nearest neighbors to recommend the highest rated movie.

## Execution Example
- The script prompts for a `user_id` and prints the recommended movie after querying another dataset.

## Potential Enhancements
- Suggestions for handling edge cases and enhancing personalization of the recommendation logic.
